## Are Questions really Powerful?

Questions are some of the most powerful words ever. Questions about the unknown have led to some of the greatest inventions and discoveries of mankind. It doesn’t have to be an overly complicated question either. Sometimes, a simple “what if” is all it takes to make the impossible possible. Questions are also powerful as they are tools to help us extract information about a problem we may have from someone who possesses this information. This is very important to Software Engineers as we will undoubtedly run into problems all the time. However, a question is only as powerful as the amount of thought and effort that is put into it. You could have an amazing question. But, if you put little thought and effort to try and convey that question to others in a meaningful way then you will most likely receive little to no help.

## The Good Versus the Bad

 As Eric Raymond puts it simply, there are good questions and bad questions, which all depends on where you ask the question, how you ask the question, and how technical the question is. As a Software Engineer, you wouldn’t ask a question about Javascript on a forum dedicated to computer hardware problems. Also, say you have a problem with your homework assignment and you need help. Don’t just outright ask for the solution. You have to explain your attempt at the problem, where you think the error is coming from, and for any pointers towards the right solution. Another problem is that if you don’t provide enough details about the problem you have then people won’t be able to help you. Lastly, if you ask a question that can easily be solved with a simple google search or shows that you lack even the most basic understanding of the subject, then you will be ignored and probably mocked by others.

## Bad Questions

Searching for bad questions on StackOverflow was an easy task. I have found two questions that exemplify perfectly how to not ask a question. In this first [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57914720/write-a-python-program-where-user-has-to-enter-5-numbers-between-1-and-100-chec) the poster is asking how to use a conditional statement in Python to determine if the eight numbers a user has inputted is between 1 and 100. This poster made three big mistakes. First, learning how to write a conditional statement requires little more than a simple google search. Secondly, the question is worded in a way where the person is just asking outright for the answer. Lastly, it is never shown or stated in the question that the poster attempted to solve their problem and what solution or errors they are currently receiving. In this second [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57915163/im-trying-to-create-a-bool-function-that-evaluates-a-char-and-returns-true-if-c) the poster is asking what is wrong with their function. The function is supposed to return true if the function receives a certain set of characters and false otherwise. The reason why the poster asked a bad question was that their error stemmed from not having a basic understanding of C++. In their if statement they used "or" instead of the correct C++ or operator. Also, they had to compare the input to each character instead of all the characters.

## A Good Question

While searching StackOverflow I found this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57914673/measuring-similarity-between-two-rgb-images-in-python) that is the perfect example of how a question should be asked. The poster wants to compute a similarity metric between two images and wants to know if there is a function that exists that can compare two 3-D images or transform the 3-D images into 1-D images while preserving the information of the image. The poster attempted the problem and posted their attempt, shows that his function outputs an error, provides an explanation on what they think can solve the problem, and only asks if a function exists not for someone to complete the program. Another plus is that someone provided links for the poster to read and instead of the poster just asking for the answer they thank the person and read the links.
