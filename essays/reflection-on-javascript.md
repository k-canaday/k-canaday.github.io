If I could sum up my experiences with Javascript so far in just one word, I would choose simplified. With my background in programming from purely a C/C++ standpoint, I found Javascript to be very simple in regards to many things. For example, when declaring variables in Javascript all you need is let or var. Compare this to C/C++ where each variable must be explicitly assigned based on its type. Another amazing thing about Javascript is that there is a lot of amazing and convenient built-in functions that greatly simplifies the entire process. I think that the greatest thing about Javascript is that you don't have to deal with pointers! Overall, I think that Javascript is a very important language for any software engineer to learn as it is easy to pick up on, very friendly for beginners, is very flexible, and is what virtually all webpages are programmed in.

Before taking ICS 314 I had no clue what athletic software engineering was. Now that I have a better grasp on the concept I think that it is a great concept as it emphasizes precision, working with time constraints, and how to perform well under pressure. I found that the practice WOD's were useful in that its intended goal was as successful as the effort you put into it. If you worked on the WOD without searching for answers during the session, worked within the time constraint, and only looked at the solution after your attempt(s), it gave you a good idea on how a true WOD would be and showed if you really grasped the concepts in that module. However, if you just searched up the answers and didn't give yourself any time constraints, your results would be the exact opposite. I see the WOD's as a great way to practice athletic software engineering and that it is a practice I can see working for me.
