I have always been fascinated with computers and how they work from both a hardware and software perspective. I didn’t have too many opportunities to learn in-depth about computers, spare some Youtube videos and random webpages with just gave basic level information. So when deciding on what my college major would be I thought it best to choose Computer Engineering as I would learn both the software and hardware aspects of computers.

So far in my educational journey I have gained valuable knowledge on how computers work in a very technical aspect. I have learned many subjects such as data and memory manipulation, microprocessor design, and programming in C and C++. I have also gained valuable knowledge in many Electrical Engineering subjects such as reading and designing circuit schematics, learning the science behind different microelectronic devices and how they are implemented, and general knowledge on different types of common circuits.

Although I have gained all this knowledge, one subject that I haven’t really had any particular experience in was using software to create applications such as websites. So in the future, I hope that I am able to learn Javascript proficient enough to be able to create websites and experience programming in a different way from what I am used to. Even though I am a Computer Engineering major and not an ICS major I expect that the knowledge I will learn will help me become more versatile in my career.
