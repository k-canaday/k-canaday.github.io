## What Class did I take?
This Fall 2019 semester I took a class titled ICS 314. The subject for this class was on website application development; namely website programming languages such as Javascript, HTML, and CSS. A unique aspect about ICS 314 however was that the Professor, Phillip Johnson, focused website application development around the idea of Software Engineering concepts. In particular, we learned about concepts such as working with time constraints, programming with standards, using programming environments, and making ethical decisions.
