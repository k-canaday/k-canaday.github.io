## What Class did I take?
This Fall 2019 semester I took a course titled ICS 314. The subject for this class was on website application development; namely website programming languages such as Javascript, HTML, and CSS. A unique aspect about ICS 314 however was that the Professor, Phillip Johnson, focused website application development around the idea of Software Engineering concepts. In particular, we learned about concepts such as working with time constraints, programming with standards, using programming environments, and making ethical decisions.   

## The Professional Skills I Acquired
Out of the many things I learned in this course I would say that the two most important skills that I gained outside of website development were agile project management and Software Engineering ethics. Agile project management refers to dividing tasks in a project into smaller tasks that can be solved in a relatively short time period (2-3 days). This allows for small groups to quickly deliver incremental updates, quickly find and fix any problems, and quickly adapt to any new tasks that arrive. Software Engineering ethics refers to making ethical decisions about the applications that you work on and develop as a Software Engineer.

## The Applicability of these Skills
I believe that agile project management is a valuable skill in the workforce as it is an effective way to quickly churn out progress, while also ensuring that any problems that arise can be dealt with efficiently and effectively. That way, there is always progress that can presented to a boss or customer. Also, if a new feature needs to be added, changed, or removed; groups can adapt easily as the work is done in small increments. I believe that this skill is best applied in small groups as each individual has a task that they can work on in a timely manner. This prevents the individuals from feeling overwhelmed or finishing too quickly and having nothing to do. I also believe that this skill is best applied in small projects as bigger projects will end up being split into many pointless tasks

I believe that Software Engineering ethics is a valuable skill in the workforce as it can effectively project an image of your company, and to an extent you as a person, to the rest of the world. It teaches you to be mindful of your actions and to work with a greater purpose of benefiting the human race as a whole. Doing work that is unethical projects an image that you are untrustworthy, have a complete and utter disregard for other's well-being (physically or mentally), and have no regards for any potential consequences.
