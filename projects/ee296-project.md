For this project my partner and I chose to create a puzzle alarm clock using an Arduino Uno and the MIT Appinventor. The puzzle alarm clock functions as any other alarm clock would: you set a timer, it counts down, and an alarm will sound when the timer is complete. For this alarm clock however, we added a new feature where in order to turn off the alarm a circuit puzzle must first be completed on the breadboard. The alarm speaker was implemented using the Arduino Uno and a breadboard, and the alarm timer was implemented with the MIT Appinventor.
