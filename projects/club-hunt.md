## What is Manoa Club Hunt?
UH Manoa has over 200 active clubs, both official and nonofficial. However, there is no easy way for a person to find or even browse through this list of clubs. The goal of Manoa Club Hunt is to enable people in the UH Manoa community to search for clubs to join in a simplified manner. The application provides a directory of clubs that a person can filter based on interests. Clicking on a club's profile will display information about the club including a website link, contact email, and club description.
